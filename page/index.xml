      <description>My name is Matija Heričko, I am a 30-something year old software developer from Slovenia, currently living in Zürich in the beautiful country of Switzerland. A proud father of one very lively son, husband to a lovely wife and an enthusiastic basketball player.&#xA;I started this blog to learn more by teaching, become a better software developer and hopefully along the way help other software developers also become better at their profession.</description>

      <description>General Code complete 2 Code complete is another book that is extremely valuable and is probably one of the classics in the field. This book is a must read for any developer that wants to improve on their craft. It offers a lot of advice on writing more robust, maintainable, readable, better architected and overall more effective and efficient code. It is one of the best books on programming that exist.</description>
